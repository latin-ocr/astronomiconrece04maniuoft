ASTRONOMICON IV xiii

The simplest and evidently the oldest is that given by Paulus
Alexandrinus fol. A 2-4 and B 2, recurring in Ludw. Maxim. pp.
112-9‚ and, with Egyptian constellations named instead of Greek, in
cod. Vat. Gr. 1056 fol. 281¹· printed by F. Boll on p. 296 of his sphaera,
and again, with only one important difference, in an Armenian MS
from which it has been extracted at c.O.A.G. 1v p. 126.

Aries : Περσίσ

Taurus : Βαβυλών

Gemini ε Καππαδοκία

Cancer z Ἀρμενία

Leo : Ἀσία

Virgo τ Ἑλλάσ 01· Ἰωνία 01· ιΕλλὸισ καὶ Ἰωνία
Libra: Λιβύη ΟΙ· Λιβύη καὶ Κυρήνη
Scorpius: Ἰταλία (Cretenses cod. Armen.)

Sagittarius: Κρήτη <Itali cod. Armen.)

Capricornus: Συρία

Aquarius : Αἴγυπτοσ

Pisces : Ἰνδία or Ἐρυθρὰ θάλασσα καὶ Ἰνδικὴ χώρα.

It was devised when the world was small and nothing mattered much
beyond the eastern Mediterranean and the west of Asia. The west
and north of Europe are unknown to it 3 there is no Scythia nor even
any Ethiopia or Arabia 3 the only far distant land which enters its
circle is India. It shows affinity with Manilius only in four or at most
five signs: Aries, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces, and perhaps Aquarius.

Next, as it seems, in antiquity, and nearer than the others to
Manilius, is the scheme of Dorotheus Sidonius, reported by Hephaestio
pp. 47-66 and recorded after him in Ludw. Maxim. pp. 112-9 : the
verses which Hephaestio cites from Dorotheus' poem are collected
in Koechly’s Manetho pp. 113 sq. and O.C.A.G. VI pp. 93 sq. The
lands of earth have now become too many for the signs of the zodiac‚
and some constellations are charged with the care of three or more
countries apiece.

Aries z Babylon and Ἀρραβίη γείτων χθονόσ Αἰγύπτοιο
(probably the country between the Red Sea
and the Nile, assigned by many geographcrs
not to Africa and Egypt but to Asia and
Arabia)

Taurus : Media and Arabia and Egypt (apparently
Arabia east of the Red Sea and Egypt west
of the Nile)

ἔστι δὲ Κριῷ ὑποτεταγμένα κλίματα τάδε
ἐμπρόσθια, Βαβυλωνία
κεφαλὴ, Έλυμαίσ
δεξιὰ, Περσίσ
ἀριστερὰ, Συρία κοίλη καὶ οἱ συνεχεῖσ τόποι
κατὰ τὴν ἐπιστροφὴν τοῦ προσώπου Βαβυλωνία (again)
κατὰ τὸ στῆθοσ Ἀρμενία
ὑπὸ τοὺσ ὤμουσ Θρᾴκη
κατὰ τὴν κοιλίαν Καππαδοκία καὶ Σουσία καὶ Ἐρυθρὰ θάλασσα
καὶ ἡ Ῥυπαρά (whatever that may be)
ὀπίσθια, Αἴγυπτοσ καὶ ὁ Περσικὸσ ὠκεανόσ.

Αἰγύπτιοι
κατὰ μὲν τὸν ἀριστερὸν ὦμον Βαβυλωνία
κατὰ δὲ τὸν δεξιὸν Θρᾴκη
κατὰ δὲ τὸ στῆθοσ· Ἀρμενία
κατὰ δε πλευρὰσ Ἀραβία ἡ πρὸσ Αἴγυπτον
κατὰ τὴν ῥάχιν καὶ κοιλίαν Περσῖσ καὶ Καππαδοκία, Μεσο-
ποταμία, Συρία, Ἐρυθρὰ θάλασσα.

There is 110 need to speak of later variatione, accommodated to the
progress of history, such as are cited from Arabian sources in
O.C.A.G. lv p. 126, vii pp. 137-9, V iii pp. 131 sq. In some of
these the planets aecompany (as indeed they do in Ptolemy)
or even supersede the zodiaca] signs; and fragments of systems
allotting regions of the earth to planetary control are found in the
Bernese scholia of Lucan, Usener p. 288, and in the late ἀποτελεσ-
ματικὴ πραγματεία falsely attributed to Stephanus of Alexandria,
pp. 22 sq. ed, Usen., ind. schol. Bonn. 1879-80.

Signs of the zodiae are figured on certain coins of certain towns
(Eekhel. doctr. num. uet. 111 pp. 283-5, Barolay Head hist. num. 1911
pp. 775 sq.‚ 77 9, 815 sq.)‚ and in some cases the association of town
and sign aceords with one or other of the foregoing systems: Aries
on coins of Antiochia ad Oronten and Cyrrhus (Syria Manil.) 5 of
Nisibis (Babylon Doroth.) 3 Leo on coins of Miletus (Asia Paul.
Alex) 3 Scorpius on coins of Commagene (Ptol.) 3 Capricorn on coins
of Commagene and Zeugma (Syria Paul. Alex). But Libra on coins
of Palmyra has no countenanee from our astrologerS‚ and Sagittarius
on coins of Rhesaena and Singara no better parallel than the κατὰ
τὴν οὐρὰν Μεσοποταμία of Odapsus.

In my commentary I have noted under each sign of the zodiac

vi M. MANILII

Thessigns are divided and distributed thus:

1 Aries 1 Aries
Aries {2 Taurus eo{2 Taurus
3 Gemini 3 Gemini
1 Cancer 1 Cancer
Taurus {2 Leo Virgo {2 Leo
3 Virgo 3 Virgo
1 Libra 1 Libra
Gemini {2 Scorpius Libra {2 Scorpius
3 Sagittarius 3 Sagittarius
1 Capricorn 1 Capricorn
Cancer {2 Aquarius Scorpius {2 Aquarius
3 Pisces 3 Pisces
1 Aries
Sagittarius {2 Taurus
3 Gemini
sl lCancer
Capricorn 12 Leo
3 Virgo
[1 Libra

Aquarius 2 Scorpius
3 Sagittarius

1 Capricorn
Pisces {2 Aquarius
3 Pisces.

Through confusion and negligence Manilius has disturbed the
arrangement by allotting the 1⁸¹⁵ and 2¹²d parts of Pisces to Aries and
Taurus instead of Capricorn and Aquarius.

This division of the 12 signs into 36 parts measuring 10 degrees
each is found in other astrologers‚ and by some of them the thirds
are called ὃεκανοί. But more commonly they use the term δεκανόσ
to signify‚ not 10 degrees of the zodiac, but a power presiding over
them. This power is nowhere except in Manilius a zodiacal sign.

It is natural to connect the triple division of a sign by decads with
the similar though less accurate division of the month which is
effected by the Egyptian week of ten days A special name is
assigned to each δεκανόσ by Hephaestio 11, and these names are
easily recognised as Egyptian and as identical in many cases with
the names assigned in Egyptian lists (Brugsch Geogr. Inschr.

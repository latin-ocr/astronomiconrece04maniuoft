x M. MANILII

90 6 (222 Rc.) δεκανικόσ, 91 15 (244 Or 219 B.C.) ὃεκανικόσ With
ἰδιώτησ (770ίῖοὸΙ §ream-ins). δεκανία is employed and explained by
Arrian tact. 6 1 τὸν δὲ λόχον καὶ στίχον ἤδη τινὲο· ὀνομάζουσιν, οἶδὲ
δεκανίαν, τυχὸν οἷο· ἐκ δέκα ὃ λόχοο- ἦν (he has said in 5 5 that
the λόχοσ may consist of 8 or 10 or 12 or 16 men).

Although these words are not correctly or analogically formed
from δέκα, it seems clear from their use both within and without
astrology that they contain the signification of the number 10.
Perhaps they were coined in the camp and are soldier's Greek3
though δεκάρχησ and δεκάδαρχοσ ought to have been sufficient.
Salmasius however contends, de an. clim. p. 559, that δεκανόσ is
‘ Chaldaean ’, ‘ nam ΝΠΡῬἻ illis est imaqo . . . pro facie uel προσώπῳ

ea uox sumitur’. My colleague Professor A. A. Bevan informs me
that this word is Aramaic and according to Jewish tradition is
pronounced c‘lcyalcnd.

408—501 The 30 degrees of each sign are now to be examined, not

as combined in decads, but singly and separately. Certain
os their number will be found to suffer from immoderate heat or cold,
drought or moisture, and by consequence to exert untoward
influences. The doctrine of Manilius is tabulated on the next page.
But between verses 489 and 490 there is an evident gap in the text,
which has swallowed at least one pars danwzanda of Aquarius, perhaps
more, and perhaps one or more of Capricorn. The number of partes
(Zcmnnandaa after this loss, is 101* out of 360. There is only one
place where so many as three of them occur consecutively, ὲ 29, 30,
m. 1: two are found together in four places, ‘P 6, 73 ὅ 30, 1] 13
Ω, 30, ΤΗΣ 1; Q 28, 293 perhaps in a fifth, ‘s’ 10, 11. The widest
interval between any two (apart from the gap in the MSS after 489)
is of eleven degrees, φ 28- ὅ 8 3 there are two intervals of seven,
Π 8-14, J( 18-24‚ and six of six. If Capricorn and Aquarius are
omitted as subject to doubt, the number of partes damnandae in a
sign ranges from eleven in Cancer to seven in Pisces. In all the
signs the 23¹'d degree is immune, and so is the 2¹³³, unless Aquarius

‘¹‘ Scaliger and his printers between them made 13 mistakes in enunieration,
all of which are exactly reproduced by Mr Bouche-Leolercq astr. Gr. p. 236.
In that vitiated table the partes damnandae are 98, but Mr Bouche-Leclercq
adds them up wrong and announces the sum as 70 ; and this cipher is religi-
ously copied out by Breiter vol. 11 p. 124, though in his own text of Manilius
the partes damnandae amount to 106. And it is complained that I ani not
always civil to my predecessors.

Dorotheus has thus given the 12 signs dominion over some 30
countries: Manilius has nearer 50 to dispose of, and he differs from
Dorotheus and Paulus in making some effort to show that his
disposition is not aimless or arbitrary and that reasons exist at least
in certain cases for the association of land and sign. Only ten
regions, Arabia, Ethiopia, Phrygia, Rhodes, Arcadia, Italy, Carthage,
Hammonia, Crete, and the eastern ocean, are clearly allotted to the

same signs by Dorotheus and by Manilius, whose scheme is the

following.

*Under Aquarius and Pisces Hephaestio neither names Dorotheus nor-
cites verses from his poem, but it is pretty clear that Dorotheus is his
authority for these particulars, as Ptolemy, also unnamed, is his authority for
the particulars which immediately follow these. Αἴγυπτοσ, which has already
been assigned to Taurus, is here perhaps the Delta.

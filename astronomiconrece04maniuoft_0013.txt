ASTRONOMICON IV ix

δεκανοΐσ οἱ εἰρημένοι ἑν τῷ ζῳδιακῷ κύκλῳ παρανατέλλοντεσ. έχουσι δὲ καὶ πρόσωπα
τῶν ζ’ ἀστέρων, ἅτινα συμπάθειαν έχουσι πρὸσ τοὺσ έπικειμένουσ αὑτοῖσ ἁστέρασ.
οἶον ὑπόθου τὸν ἥλιον εἶναι ὛἸ μοίρᾳ ι’, δεκανῷ πρώτῳ, προσώπῳ ὅ. ἐπεὶ οὖν
εἰρήκαμεν τὸν ἥλιον σημαίνειν τὰ ψυχικὰ, εὑρήσεισ τὴν ψυχὴν τοῦ τοιούτου ἔπανδρον,
θυμικὴν, πολεμοχαρῆ, φίλοπλον, καὶ τὰ ὅμοια. ὑπόθου δὲ πάλιν εἶναι τὸν ἥλιον φ
μοίρᾳ κ’, δεκανῷ δευτέρῳ, προσώπῳ Ἠλίου. σημαίνει τὸν τοιοῦτον λαμπρὸν εἶναι τὴν
ψυχὴν καὶ φιλότιμον καὶ φιλόδοξον καὶ οὐκέτι πολεμοχαρῆ. ὑπόθου δὲ πάλιν τὸν
ἥλιον εἶναι ‘w μοίρᾳ λ’, δεκανῷ τρίτῳ, προσώπῳ ῼ. σημαίνει δέ τὸν τοιοῦτον εἶναι
θηλυκόψυχον, θηλύμορφον, ἕπαισχρον, λα’γνὸν, καὶ τὰ ὅμοια. . . ἕκκεινται δὲ καὶ τῶν
δεκανῶν καὶ τῶν παρανατελλόντων αὐτοΐσ καὶ τῶν προσώπων τὰ ἀποτελέσματα παρὰ.
Τεύκρου τοῦ Βαβυλωνίου.

The δεκανοί are ignored by Manetho, Ptolemy, and Vettius Valens, and
are left in peace by Sextus empiricus.

From the words of Firmicus‚ IV 22 2 Nechepso, iustissimus Aeqypti
imperator et astroloqus ualde bonus, per ipsos decanos omnia uitia
ualitudinesque colleqit ostendeus quam ualitudinem qui d e c a η u s efficeret,
and from Porphyry's mention of οῖ παλαιοί in isag. p. 199, it would
seem that the term δεκανόσ- occurred in the work bearing the names
of N echepso and Petosiris, which belonged perhaps to the 21Μί century
before Christ. The first extant example of its astrological use is in
papyr. Brit. mus. CXXX (catal. Ι pp. 133-9)‚ a geniture not earlier than
A.D. 81 : ll. 66-8 δεκανῷ δευτέρῳ (comprising Aries 14⁰ δ’) καλουμένῳ
σενταχορ, 89-91 δεκανῷ δευτέρῳ (Of Taurus) καλουμένῳ αρωθ, 171 sq.
δεκανὸν θουμωθ (comprising Scorpius 18⁰). In another geniture,
pap. Brit. mus. XCVIII (catal. Ι pp. 128 sq.), perhaps of A.D. 154, it
occurs thrice, but its sense and grammatical construction are alike
obscure. Teucer Babylonius, whom Porphyry isag. p. 200 and others
name as an authority on δεκανοί, perhaps wrote in the 1⁵⁴t century
after Christ, as also did Chaeremon, to whom Porphyry ap. Euseb.
praep. euang. ΙΙΙ 4 (p. 92) attributes a mention of τὰσ- εἰσ τοὺσ-
δεκανοὺσ· τομάσ.

Outside astrology δεκανόσ is found as early as the 2¹¹d century
before Christ, papyr. Tebtun. 27 31 τῶν κατὰ κώμην δε κ α νῶ ν τῶν
φυλακιτῶν, where it is the title of an officer of police ς it recurs in
pap. Tebt. 251, of the 1⁵t century before Christ, where its sense is not
apparent; in pap. Oxyr. 11 387, of the lSt century after Christ,
δεκανοί appear in company with σταθμοῦχοσ, ἐκφόδιοσ· (ἐφοδικόσ- (ἱ),
and προφήτησ, in Cagnat's inscr. Gr. Rom. Ι 1046 δεκανῶν τῶν ἐν
στόλῳ πραιτωρίῳ (A.D. 166) the word signifies some sort of naval
officer3 in Vegetius its military meaning is defined, r. mil. 11 8
decani, denis militibus praepositi. δεκανικόσ is found earlier: pap.
Hibeh 1 96 21 (259 Rc.) ὃ ε κ αν ι κ ο ῦ (εάεοαγίοηίε), and elsewhere
in the abbreviation Δε, eg. 81 16 (238 Bc.) with λοχαγόο- 3

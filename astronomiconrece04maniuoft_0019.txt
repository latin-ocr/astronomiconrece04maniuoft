ASTRONOMICON IV xv

Aquarius: (Egypt Ζ), Tyre, Cilicia, (Lycia 2)
Pisces: Euphrates, Tigris, the eastern ocean, Parthia,
Bactra, Babylon, Susa.

A very different scheme, more methodical in appearance, is pro-
pounded by Ptolemy tetr. pp. 15¹¹·-19 ed. Camerar. 1535 and sum-
marised in Heph. Theb. pp. 47 -66, Ludw. Maxim. pp. 112-9, Lyd. de
ostent. Wachsm. pp. 158-60. He divides the inhabited earth into four
quadrants, after Eratosthenes, by two lines drawn from west to east
and from north to south and roughly corresponding to the parallel
and meridian of Rhodes. The north-west quadrant he assigns to the
lgt zodiacal trigon collectively, Aries Leo Sagittarius 3 the south-east
to the 2⁸0¹, Taurus Virgo Oapricorn ; the north-east to the 3¹d, Gemini
Libra Aquarius ,- and the south—west to the 4⁰³, Cancer Scorpius
Pisces. But certain lands in the quadrant have special affinity with
certain signs in the trigon: thus, to take the 1⁰t trigon and the
north-west quadrant, Aries is most closely related to Britain, Gaul,
Germany, and Bastarnia. Moreover lands situate at the inner angle
of a quadrant have affinity with the trigon ruling the quadrant
diametrically opposite ,- so that the north-westerly countries of the
south-east quadrant, ruled by Taurus Virgo and Capricorn, are
⁴related also to the signs of the 1St trigon, and Aries in particular is
thus brought into connexion with Coelesyria‚ Palestine‚ Idumaea,
and Iudaea, countries external to his own quadrant.

There are further two systems of distribution κατὰ μέροσ, by
which the lands of earth are allotted not to signs but to portions of
signs. One of these is set forth by Valens 1 2 pp. 6-14 and thence
copied into Ludw. Maxim. pp. 112 sqq. The other, copied in the
same place, is given by Hephaestio pp. 47-66 and is ascribed by him
to* ἄλλοι or τινὲσ· or Αἰγύπτιοι or Ὠδαψόσ. For Aries Taurus
Gemini Cancer and Leo this system differs more or less considerably
from that of Valens 3 for Virgo Libra Scorpius and Sagittarius there
is in the extant text of Valens no provision of domains ; for Capri-
corn and Pisces the two systems agree, and for Aquarius they do not
differ much. Little method or care is observable in either, and the
same country is often subjected to two or more dominations in both :
Syria for instance finds no fewer than eight morsels of the zodiac
incumbent over it. It will be enough to cite Aries and his subject
‘lands as a specimen of both systems

*At p. 47 20 under Aries he says ὡσ ’Ίππαρχοσ καὶ οἱ παλαιοὶ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων

κατὰ μέροσ διώρισαν, but at p. 60 30 sqq. under Sagittarius he ascribes to
Hipparchus a distribution differing from that of Odapsus.

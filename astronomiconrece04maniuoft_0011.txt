ASTRONOMICON IV vii

Antiqu. de l'Egypte 1 pp. 79-90) to certain celestial beings, which
however are not called by any Egyptian term akin to δεκανοί,
616 1101 attached 10 zodiacal but rather to extra-zodiacal constella-
tions, and 616 sometimes more or fewer than 36. Of their emblems
figured by Lepsius Chronol. d. Aegypt. Ι pp. 66 sq. none presents or
resembles a complete human form, but each consists of an assemblage
of signs, among which a bird or a human head or limb is often to be
recognised. The names of δεκανοί in the Hermes of Pitra's analect.
sacr. 61 class. V ii pp. 285-90 (codd. Mosqu. 415 et Vind. med. Gr.
23) are further removed than Hephaestio's from the Egyptian 3 those
in Firmicus math. 1v 22 8-19 further still 3 those in G.O.A.G. VI pp.
7 3-8 (codd. Vind. phil. Gr. 108 et Par. Gr. 2419) have 110 resemblance
to them, and are said in the Paris MS to be given κατὰ Χαλδαίων
φωνάσ. To each name is attached in C.G.A.G. V1 an emblem
for inscription on an amulet of some special stone: these emblems
are mostly arrangements of lines, with hooks at the ends, within
circles. Pitra’s Hermes gives a description of each δεκανόσ, and the
forms described 616 for the most part human, often with the heads of
lower animals. In C.C.A.G. 11 pp. 153-7 (codd. Ven. Marc. 334 et
Par. Gr. 2420) there is a chapter from the astrologer Achmes (saec.
X) with a different set of descriptions derived from a tradition which
has left its mark elsewhere. Of the 1⁷³t δεκανόσ of Aries we read
here ἐν τῇ χειρὶ afli-02* ἀξίνη, ἣν καὶ θέλει ἀπορρῖψαι, and again in
Westermann's paradoxogr. pp. 147—8 (Psellus‚ quoting Teucer Baby-
lonius) εἶσὶ γὰρ ἐν ἑκάστῳ τῶν ζῳδίων τρεῖσ κατειλεγμένοι δεκανοὶ
ποικιλόμορφοι, ὁ μὲν κατέχων πέλεκυν, ὃ δ’ εἰσ ἄλλο τι ἐσχηματισ-
μένοσ εἶκόνισμα. This figure with the axe appears as the 1ει δεκανόσ
of Aries in Bianchini’s ‘so-called planisphere‚ perhaps of the 2²¹‘1 cen-

tury aster Christ (S. Reinach Repertoire dela statuaire 1 p. 118, Boll
sphaer. tafel V).

Manilius, as Ι have said, is the only author who subJ'ects these
divisions of 10⁰ to the dominion of signs of the zodiac. Astrologers
for 1116 most part allot them to the seven planete : Firm. 11 4 2 sq.‚
Paul. Alex. fol. C 2-3‚ Porph. isag. pp. 199 sq.‚ C.C.A.G. 11 pp.

The planets succeed and recur in the usual descending sequence,
Saturn Jupiter Mars Sun Venus Mercury Moon (though in
C.C.A.G. VI pp. 7 5-8 the scribe has made some blunders)3 but the
series begins with Mars in the 1Et decan of Aries, and consequently
(since 36 is 1 more than 7 >< 5) it also ends with Mars in the 3rd
decan of Pisces, so that Mars holds two consecutive decane, and one

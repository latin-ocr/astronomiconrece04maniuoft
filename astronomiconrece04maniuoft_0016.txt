was an exception; the 16th and perhaps the 12ωι are immune in all
but Sagittarius. The 25ωὶ is a pars damnanda in eight of the twelve,
the 27 th in six3 and if the verse or verses now missing after 489
were present the 1gt or 7t¹¹ or 29ὼ or 30ιιι might be brought to a
level with the 27th.

I have found no counterpart to this scheme anywhere else, and I
have discovered no plan or principle at the bottom of it.

Hephaestio 1 1 gives the λαμπραὶ μοῖραι of the 12 signs. These have no
relation to anything visible in the heavens nor to any fact of astronomy.
There are 64 λαμπραὶ μοῖραι out of 360 (Mr Bouche-Leclercq’s table p. 236 omits
2 of them), and their frequency ranges from 7 in the sign of Leo to 4 in Gemini
and Libra. The scheme has nothing to do with that of Manilius, for a good
many μοῖραι which are λαμπραί in the one are damnandae in the other z the 27ιιι of
Aries, the 17ῑ11 and 28ὼ and 30th of Taurus, and so on.

Paulus fol. D 1-2 has a table of uovouocplac,-that is degrees oi the zodiac
separately considered,—but this too stands in no relation to Manilius. It
attributes all the degrees of a sign in regular and recurring order to the
dominion of the seven planete, and it is not represented as signifying any
distinctions of good and evil. His table τῆο· κατὰ τρίγωνον μονομοιρίασ in
Q 3-4 is equally foreign to our purpose.

Firmicus VIII 19-30 enumerates one by one all the degrees of all the 12 signs
and describes their special influence as horoscopes. These chapters too have no
relevancy here : for example, in Manilius the ΘΗ) degree of Aries is uon salubris,
but Firmicus says iu Arietis parte VJ quicumque habuerit horoscopum, erit
amicus reglum et potentium iudicum mawimorum, illustribus ornatus diyuitatis
iusiyuibus et omnia in se ylorz'ae ornamenta circumferens. The title of another
chapter, Iv 22, de meantibus locis et plenis, looks promising at first, but the
scheme which it expounds is not even a scheme of μονομοιρίαι. According
to Firmicus, and, if we take his word for it, to N eche-pso, the three decani
to whom each sign is attributed do not occupy its whole extent: a certain
number of successive degrees they occupy, and these are pleui5 a certain
number, also successive, they do not, and these are uacui. Thus in Aries the
three decani occupy only the degrees 4-8, 18-21, 27-30 ; the degrees 1-3‚ 9-17,
22-26 are unoccupied and therefore inferior, ‘nam qui nec horam nec aliquam
scellam iu plenis habuerint partibus eruut miseri destituti semper ec pauperes.
It is manifest that this has nothing in common with Manilius.

After a long geographical preamble Manilius unfolds the
plan upon which the lands and regions of the earth are
allotted to the dominion of the several signs of the zodiac. It is
one of six or more competing systemS, and it differs from all the rest
much more than it agrees with any. Three of these are registered
by Hephaestio 1 1 (pp. 47-66 Engelbr.) 3 and in cod. Laur. XXVIII 34
fol. 15311· sqq. printed by A. Ludwich on pp. 112-9 of his Maximus
there is a collection of five, two or more of which are blended in
C.O.A.G. IV pp. leo—2 and VII pp. 194-212.

Although this Fourth book presents more difficulties of detail than
any other of the five, and has exacted from me the writing of a very
long commentary‚ it has not the essential difficulty, astrologica} or
astronomicaL of books 11 and 111 ; and the only parts of it which

need to be explained or illustrated in a preface are the verses
294-386‚ 408-501, and 744-817.

In 11 693-737 we were apprised that each of the 12
signs is divided into 12 portioris called dodecatemorieS,
and that the 12 dodecatemories in each sign are allotted to the
12 signs in order. But this device is not confusing enough to
mantle the frauds of astrology3 and the 12 signs, thus parcelled
and mixed by twelfths, are now to be parcelled and mixed anew by
thirds. Manilius calls this department of his art decanica.

Every sign is divided into three parts consisting of lO degrees
each, so that the zodiae, with its 360 degreeS‚ contains 36 of them.
These 36 parts, beginning with the 1⁸⁶ of Aries, are allotted to the
dominion of the 12 signs, beginning with Aries himself, in regular
suceession and triple recmrence, so that each sign dominates three
of them, and those three fall at the three angles of an equilateral
triangle inscribed in the circle.
